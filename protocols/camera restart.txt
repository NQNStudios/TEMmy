1. In digital micrograph uninsert the camera
2. On the camera controller (behind the monitors and column sitting on the casing with a glowing blue button) hold your thumb over the glowing blue button for something like 5 seconds.  It won't depress, but it is a button
3. Wait like a few minutes for any sort of cache to clear
4. Hold your thumb over the button again until it glows blue (again its a terrible button with no tactile feedback)
5. you should now be able to reinsert the camera from digital micrograph
