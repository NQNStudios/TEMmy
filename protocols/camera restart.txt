1. In digital micrograph uninsert the camera
2. On the camera controller (behind the monitors and column sitting on the casing with a glowing blue button) hold your thumb over the glowing blue button for something like 5 seconds.  It won't depress, but it is a button
	(The blue light will start blinking on and off,  possibly never going completely dark)
3. Wait like a few minutes for any sort of cache to clear
4. Hold your thumb over the button again until it glows blue (again its a terrible button with no tactile feedback)
5. reopen Digital micrograph and go into Help > User Mode > select POwer User mode
6. you should now be able to reinsert the camera from Camera > Insert Camera
the next time you press record in SerialEM, it may tell you that the camera's temperature is not yet stabilized. Wait a while before trying again.
