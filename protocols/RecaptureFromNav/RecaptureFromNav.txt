1.      Select the nav item corresponding to each area you want to capture. It should have the "Acquire" checkbox checked. (For 99.9% of captures this is only Nav Item #1)
a.      Reselect "New File at Item" (Screenshot #1)
b.      A dialog pops up, select "montaged Images" & "Fit montage to polygon", hit OK (Screenshot #2)
c.      The montage setup pops up, it should match the standard settings. Hit OK (Screenshot #3)
d.      You'll be prompted to choose where to save the montage. Do not replace the first montage (unless no tiles were ever captured.) Instead create a new folder and add a letter after the section number. Continue moving up the alphabet if there is more than one attempt "B", "C", "D", etcâ€¦ The letter convention only applies to the folder. Naming the .idoc file inside the folder with only the section number. 
2.      Go to "Navigator->Acquire at items" menu. (Screenshot #4)
a.      Ensure that the "CalibrateAndRecapture" macro is being used since this is a recapture.
b.      Ensure other settings follow standard procedure (Screenshot #5)
c.      Click Go
