Ok, rough mapping is (OpR-Marc-____):
X:\ Syn1    155.100.104.158
W:\Syn2     155.100.107.198
V:\Syn3     155.100.106.5
Y:\RC2  155.100.104.153

Then I have SynBkp on Z:

Most annotator machines however have Z: as MarcLabHD (not OpR-Marc, just 155.100.105.73\MarcLab)

And D:\ is referring to the D drive on Build1

I don't tend to map Build1 because I only use it remoting in.

none of them can be accessed without the vpn on

Its just if you are using a vpn and connecting to the Syn machines for some reason windows wants the ip to map them right.  When the machine is physically located in the moran I don't have that issue and the names work fine

use \Data
