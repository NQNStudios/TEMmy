Filament Change TEM1
====
- Turn off HT voltage & Filament 
    - If the filament was just on, wait ~60min for it to cool down
- Raise screen and switch to a rod with no grid in it
    
Under cabinet (panel under the Gatan monitor will open if you push it)
----
- Move gun switch to 'air'
    - Valves V18, V15, and V10 will open (turn green) in TEM Center. 
    - wait 5mins
-Lift to 'up'
TEM Upper assembly
----
- Move grounding arm out of way.
- Unscrew ring.  
- Pull directly down on filament (Wehnelt) cap. It does not screw or turn.
- New wehnelt caps are stored in clear cylindrical cases in main EM room, if you have questions ask Nat. 
    - New cap needs to be aligned prior to inserting it into the TEM.  
    - Do this using the two part metal system that the cap fits into (see help menu in TEM Center for image)
    - Turn the assembly under the microscope to move the filament to match its positioning seen in the filament just removed from scope.  
        **This could use alot more specific detail**
 
- Take new wehnelt cap and fit notch on edge of assembly, then push the cap up into position (do not turn the cap as you push)  
- Screw the ring back on.  
- Move grounding arm back to stop point (touching the new wehnelt cap).  
    - Move switch under cabinet to put gun down.  
- If assembly not sitting flat, check the gasket that seals around the gun.  
    - Gun air switch to pump.
    - Push both reset buttons.  
    
- Once the reset buttons are pushed and the gun is switched to the pump position
    - Valves V18 and V15 will close immediately, V10 will close when the PiG2 value reaches ~160uA
    - You should see the GunPiG2 value begin to drop in TEMCenter soon after flipping switch.  
    - If you don't see the pressure begin to drop, restart TEM Center. 
- After PiG2 Gun vacuum is pumped down (turns green and reads "Evac Ready") the penning guage will begin to drop.
IMPORTANT: You must wait for the Penning Gauge to stabilize below 20, this will take 45mins to an hour.  
    
New Filament Conditioning
====
- In TEM Center, open the HT Scheduling Window from the HT and filament window. 
    
- HT Voltage to 30 
    HT Scheduler settings
    ----
    Step volt: 1.0kV
    Interval: 2 sec
    Target: 30kV
    
**Set Filament target to 72 and Turn Filament ON**
- Watch the Penning gauge (PG) valve, this should stay near starting value (11/4/2020 it was 10)
IMPORTANT: If the PG rises above 20, stop the scheduler and wait for the PG to stabilize (~5mins)
- HT Voltage to 40
    HT Scheduler settings
    ----
    Step volt: 1.0kV
    Interval: 5 sec
    Target: 40kV
    
- Leave for 1hr at 40.  
- After stabilization, step HT to 60kV. (Watch PG, if it starts to spike remember to give breaks)
    HT Scheduler settings
    ----
    Step volt: 1.0kV
    Interval: 10 sec
    Target: 60kV
    
- Step HT to 75kV (It begins to get sensitive here so you need to go slow and really watch PG)
    HT Scheduler settings (60-65)
    ----
    Step volt: 0.5kV
    Interval: 10 sec
    Target: 65kV
    HT Scheduler settings (65-70)
    ----
    Step volt: 0.5kV
    Interval: 10 sec
    Target: 70kV
    
    - Hold for 10mins at 70kV
    
    HT Scheduler settings (70-75)
    ----
    Step volt: 0.5kV
    Interval: 20 sec
    Target: 75kV
    
- At 75 this process will get much slower **It becomes really sensitive from here on** (Budget ~2hrs for the last step) 
    HT Scheduler settings (75-95)
    ----
    Step volt: 0.1kV
    Interval: 30 sec
    Target: 95kV

	If you want to be even more careful, you can choose a step volt lower than 0.1 kV in the panel with the HT on/off button, and manually trigger the steps.

Once you reach 95, leave it there for 15 minutes before lowering back to 80

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
    - This final 20kV is super sensitive. You really have to watch the PG.  If it begins to spike at all you'll need to hit "stop"
        in the scheduler and let the PG re-stabilize at it earlier value (approx 5 mins).  These spikes happen very fast. 
    If the PG starts to spike the following may happen:
        - If you hear a pop behind the machine & the HT turns off, HT was increased too
        fast and an arcing event was created.  
        - If this happens, reduce HT & turn back on.  
    
        - If you hear a pop from up by the gun & HT turns off:
            - The cap needs to be rechecked, starting the process over again. 
            - You may have 'fried' the wehnelt cap (Major problem)
    
Put SerialEM calibrations into maintenance mode. 

If you are changing TEM1's filament, also open TEM Con. Click JEOLS -> Alignment -> Maintenance.
    
Alignment of New Filament
====
- Ensure empty rod in scope.  
- Bring HT down to 80kV.
- Note the current going through the filament when it is off (Dark current). It should be ~40
- Turn filament on.
    - Should go to about 15 + the Dark current value
        - Can adjust bias to get the right current value.
        - Try to keep bias between 0-80
        
- Turn on SerialEM
    - Calibrate
- Use low-mag to find the beam.
- Switch to high-mag.  
Align Gun
----
- At 500x find center.  
- Go to 10000x
    - Spot size 1
    - Unsaturate filament by dropping target from 72
	- You will start to see the filament itself in the beam
    - Focus
    - Center Image (On TEM1, the green knobs)
    - Click Gun Align. 
    
- Resaturate, but keep it below 80
    - Won't be able to see the filament anymore
    
- Spread beam between inner bracket
    - Mirror in (spot size 3)
    - Gun align
    - Use the yellow knobs to bring the current density as high as possible. 
    
- Turn off gun align.  
- Leave condensor lens alone
    - This is taken care of at our 6 month service call
    
If spot size is not aligned
----
- Spot 1 
    - Gun align 
    - Center with green knobs. 
    - Turn the gun align back off.  
    
- Spot 4
    - Bright tilt.  
    - Center with grenn knobs
    - Bright tilt off
    
**Repeat the spot 1 and spot 4 calibrations until the beam remains centered**

TO SAVE THESE CALIBRATIONS, click Save as Neutral on all the values in SerialEM.

On TEM1, also save the configuration through TEMCon.
