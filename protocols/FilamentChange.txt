Filament Change TEM1
====

- Turn off HT voltage & Filament 
	- wait ~60min
	
Under cabinet
----

- Move gun switch to 'air' 
	- wait 5mins

-Lift to 'up'

TEM Upper assembly
----

- Move arm out of way.  
- Unscrew ring.  
- Pull down on filament (Wehnelt) cap.  
- Take new wehnelt cap and fit notch on edge of assembly.  
	- Extra cap kept cleaned in a ziploc bag in one of the main EM room drawers.  
- Replace ring (it screws).  
- Move back to stop point.  
	- Move switch to put gun down.  
- If assembly not sitting flat, check the gasket that seals around the gun.  
	- Gun air switch to pump.
	- Push both reset buttons.  
	
- Leave scope overnight.  


Wehnelt Cap Cleaning
====
- Needs to be cleaned before reinserting a new filament.  
- Cleaned using an ammonia solvent in beaker in sonicator for 1 hour.   
	- Note: This solvent is toxic, do this in the hood.  
	
	
New Filament Conditioning
====

- HT Voltage to 30 increasing stepwise by 10kV.  
	- Return step to 1.  
	
**Turn Filament ON**

- Watch the Penning gauge (PG) valve, this should stay at ~20
- Slowly bring up the HT Voltage to 40, ensuring PG valve does not change.
- Leave for 1hr at 40.  

- After stabilization, step HT to 60kV.
	- Watch PG valve and give breaks to keep in 18-22 range.   
	
- Once 60 has been attained with stable PG, reduce step size to 0.5.  
	- Continue to slowly increase the HT while paying close attention to PG.

- At 75, reduce step size to 0.1.  
**Important to increase very slowly at this point**	
	- If you hear a pop behind the machine & the HT turns off, HT was increased too
	fast and an arcing event was created.  
		- If this happens, reduce HT & turn back on.  
	
	- If you hear a pop from up by the gun & HT turns off:
		- The cap needs to be rechecked, starting the process over again. 
		- You may have 'fried' the wehnelt cap (Major problem)
	
	
Alignment of New Filament
====
- Ensure empty rod in scope.  
- Bring HT down to 80kV.
- Turn filament on.
	- Should be at ~58 (will be ~5 over due to being cold)
		- Can use bias to bring current down to within 5 over. 
		- Try to keep bias between 20-80
		
- Turn on SerialEM
	- Calibrate
- Use low-mag to find the beam.
- Switch to high-mag.  

Align Gun
----
- At 500x find center.  
	- Spot size 1
	- Unsaturate filament by dropping target (??)
	- Focus
	- Center Image (On TEM1, the green knobs)
	- Click Gun Align. 
	
- Resaturate, but keep it below 80
	- Won't be able to see the filament anymore
	
- Spread beam between inner bracket
	- Mirror in (spot size 3)
	- Gun align
	- Use the yellow knobs to bring the current density as high as possible. 
	
- Turn off gun align.  

- Leave condensor lens alone
	- This is taken care of at our 6 month service call
	
If spot size is not aligned
----
- Spot 1 
	- Gun align 
	- Center with green knobs. 
	- Turn the gun align back off.  
	
- Spot 4
	- Bright tilt.  
	- Center with grenn knobs
	- Bright tilt off
	
**Repeat the spot 1 and spot 4 calibrations until the beam remains centered**
